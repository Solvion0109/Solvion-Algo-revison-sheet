2. **Solve 50 Easy Problems** to develop intuition.  
3. **Use Patterns:**  
   - HashMaps for frequency counting.  
   - Sorting + Two Pointers for searching problems.  
   - Sliding Window for substring problems.  

### **ðŸŽ¯ Target Questions:**  
âœ” **Arrays & Hashing:**  
   - [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)  
   - [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)  
âœ” **Strings:**  
   - [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)  
   - [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)  
âœ” **Sorting & Searching:**  
   - [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)  
   - [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

2. **Learn Recursion & Backtracking** â€“ crucial for solving Trees, Graphs & DP problems.  
3. **Solve 100 Medium Problems** (NeetCode 150 or LeetCode Top Interview Questions).  
4. **Learn Debugging & Edge Cases** â€“ write down failing cases & improve efficiency.  

### **ðŸŽ¯ Target Questions:**  
âœ” **Sliding Window & Two Pointers:**  
   - [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)  
   - [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)  
âœ” **Recursion & Backtracking:**  
   - [Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)  
   - [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)  
âœ” **Linked Lists & Stacks:**  
   - [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)  
   - [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

2. **Learn Trees & Graphs** (BFS, DFS, Topological Sorting).  
3. **Solve **50+ Hard Questions** â€“ Break them into subproblems first.  
4. **Participate in LeetCode Contests** to improve problem-solving speed.  

### **ðŸŽ¯ Target Questions:**  
âœ” **Dynamic Programming:**  
   - [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)  
   - [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)  
âœ” **Graphs & Trees:**  
   - [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)  
   - [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)  
âœ” **Tries & Heap:**  
   - [Implement Trie](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)  
   - [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)
